# Mathjavadoku
A Java-based version of Mathdoku

This is a simple version of Mathdoku written in Java. It will generate puzzles from size 3 to size 9. Note that this is not a mathematically sophisticated version of Mathdoku - puzzles may have multiple correct solutions. Also, the difficulty may need to be tweaked. Puzzles of size 4 and size 5 are relatively easy to solve (again, multiple solutions may exist).

To play, click on a square, which allows you to either indicate the value of a square, or a list of potential candidates. Once the puzzle is validly solved, a congratulatory message appears. 

At the present time, the size of the puzzle is determined at the start of the program, and cannot be changed without restarting.
